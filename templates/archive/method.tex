What is the average number of tokens for the module in higher logic complexity?
What is the average number of tokens for the module description and code?

Pyranet dataset~\cite{11133406}.

% Is it an easy process for the whole Verilog modules?

In order to construct synthesis statistics for a large number of $692K$ Verilog modules of the dataset Pyranet, with specific limits in time and memory.
% 
We perform a long-run process for logic synthesis of $692K$ Verilog from the dataset. In order to prevent out-of-resource, a multi-process and resource-constrained configuration for each Verilog module. Based on this, each synthesis process of a Verilog module is limited to a 5-minute timeout and $2 GB$ of memory.

Within our synthesis scheme, statistics, the highest logic number is $1.1M$, related to a module.

Following Pyranet fine-tuning scheme, we apply \textit{Curriculum Learning} to our data after categorization with loss weighting for each tier of logic complexities.
