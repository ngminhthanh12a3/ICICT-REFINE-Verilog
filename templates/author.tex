\begin{abstract}
%
% % Basis of LLM
% \gls{llm} has shown promising potential in various aspects of \gls{rtl} design. However, partial \gls{rtl} generation still faces many challenges in reliability and reveals many unexpected logic behaviors.
% %
% % How do I address this?
% To address these challenges, we introduce \MyLLM, a comprehensive construction in both fine-tuning and inference for partial Verilog generation.
% % What is my technique?
% In dataset construction, we implement ranking-based logic with loss weighting to form expected behaviors of \gls{llm} in fine-tuning with various Verilog complexities. In Verilog generation process, we implement dedicated techniques to resolve unusual results in prompting and logic behaviors of \gls{llm} output.
% % 
% % Result
% On applying \MyLLM on DeepSeek-Coder-7B, our 7B-sized model outperforms other commercial and open-source \gls{llm} in the task Code Completion of VerilogEval V2.
% % 
% % What is the contribution of this work?
% Finally, \MyLLM constructs strong foundation in partial Verilog generation of further hybrid architecture for \gls{llm}-powered\gls{rtl} design.
% % 
% Our public \gls{llm} and \break source code can be accessed at \url{https://huggingface.co/nvmthanhhcmus/LORAV-DeepSeek-Coder}.
% 
% Paraphrase
\glspl{llm} have demonstrated strong potential across multiple stages of \gls{rtl} design, but partial \gls{rtl} generation still suffers from reliability issues and can exhibit unforeseen logic behaviors. To overcome these limitations, we propose \MyLLM, a comprehensive framework that constructs both fine-tuning and inference for partial Verilog generation. For dataset construction, we adopt a ranking-based strategy with loss weighting to encourage the desired \gls{llm} behavior during fine-tuning across a range of Verilog complexities. During generation, we further apply specialized methods to mitigate anomalous prompting outcomes and incorrect logic patterns in \gls{llm} outputs. When applied to DeepSeek-Coder-7B, our 7B model surpasses both commercial and open-source \glspl{llm} on the VerilogEval V2 at the Code Completion task. Overall, \MyLLM\ establishes a solid foundation for partial Verilog generation and supports future hybrid architectures, such as agentic \glspl{llm}, for \gls{llm}-powered \gls{rtl} design. Our public \gls{llm} and source code are available at \break\url{https://huggingface.co/nvmthanhhcmus/LORAV-DeepSeek-Coder}.
